# document-app
Simple file management app

This is a personal project I'm developing to test out some new technologies. It's built with .Net Core 3.1 and uses a repository pattern, but the technologies that are new to me are PostgreSQL and JWT tokens. Some things that I think are cool are it uses custom authentication, a custom data access layer, and all database processes are run in stored procedures. It's a work in progress but the basic framework is set up and works properly.
